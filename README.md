This is an example to preview how the DX is when making a big router with tRPC v10.

It has a `postinstall`-script that generates 700 procedures (which you can modify in `scripts/codegen.ts`).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:trpc/examples-v10-next-big-router.git
cd examples-v10-next-big-router
yarn && code . && yarn dev
```
